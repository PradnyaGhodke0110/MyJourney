/*PROBLEMS ON N NUMBERS//
//1.IN THIS TOPIC WE ACCEPT MULTIPLE NO FROM THE USRE AND PERFORM THE OPRNS ON THAT N NUMBERS (MULTIPLE)
IN THE PREVIOUS TOPIC WE CREATE A SINGLE VARIABLE BUT IN THIS TOPIC TO STORE MULTIPLE NUMBERS WE HAVE TO CREATE AN ARRAY 
TO SOLVE THE QUESTIONS IN THIS TOPIC WE ARE GOING TO FOLLOW BELOW RULES

1.WE ARE ACCEPTING THE NO.OF ELEMNETS FROM USER
2.ACCORDING TO NO OF ELEMTS WE ARE GOING TO ALLOCATE THE MEMORY DYNAMAICALLY 
3.AFTER ALLOACTING THE DYNAMIC MEMORY WE ACCEPT ACTUAL NUMBERS FROM USER STORE IT IN THAT DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED MEMORY.
4.AFTER STORING ALL THE ELEMENTS IN THAT MEMORY WE PASS THAT ARRAY TO THE FUNCTION WHICH IS GOING TO PERFORM THE OPERATION
5.AFTER COMPLETING THE TASK WE HAVE TO DEALLOACTE THAT DYNAMIC MEMORY EXPLICITLY*/
